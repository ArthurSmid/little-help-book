# little-help-book-web

Welcome! 

The volunteers of Open Eugene are glad you're here, we're all volunteers. This is a Code for America brigade project for a social service provider in Eugene, Oregon. White Bird Clinic has received attention lately for it's ability to send social service workers to 911 distress calls, rather than police. This saves money, and it's better for people experiencing crisis. The clinic has been around a while and they have produced a resource directory that sits on the desk of social service workers throughout the city. It's called the Little Help Book â€” it's big! It's a big ol' three ring binder full of 8.5 x 11" pages. And this is expensive to produce and to update. This is where we can help.
